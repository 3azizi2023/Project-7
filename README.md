# Project-7
Deploy a Model in the Cloud

Introduction:

An AgriTech startup named "Fruits!" aims to introduce innovative solutions in the field of fruit harvesting, prioritizing the preservation of fruit diversity. This vision is realized through the development of intelligent picking robots capable of providing tailored treatments for each fruit variety.

Initially, the company seeks to increase its visibility by offering the general public a mobile application. This application will allow users to take pictures of fruits and obtain comprehensive information about these products. The initiative aims to raise public awareness about the diversity of fruits while creating a first version of the image classification engine dedicated to fruits.

Furthermore, the development of this mobile application will contribute to the implementation of the first iteration of the Big Data architecture required for the project.

Mission:

The mission involves taking charge of the work done by the intern and finalizing the processing pipeline. It is not required to train a model at the moment. The key is to establish the initial steps of the processing that will be useful when we need to handle larger volumes of data in the future!
